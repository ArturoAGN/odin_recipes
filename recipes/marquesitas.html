    <h2>Traditional Yucatecan Marquesita</h2>
    <p>Sold from street carts in most plazas and parks, marquesitas are one of Mexico’s tastiest treats.</p>
    <p> This delicious snack can either be sweet or savory, and comes loaded with flavorful fillings, making it a versatile and popular delight among locals.</p>
    <p>A marquesita is a thin wafer dessert that originated from Mérida, Mexico. The dough is rolled and stuffed with various fillings such as custard, chocolate, caramel, or cheese. These delicious treats were invented during a cold winter by an ice cream vendor to offset his seasonal decline in sales.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 eggs plus 2 egg whites</li>
        <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup canola oil</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher or coarse sea salt</li>
        <li>2/3 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add all of the batter ingredients to a blender and puree until smooth. Set aside and let rest for 10 minutes, or cover and refrigerate up to 12 hours. Stir before using.</li>
        <li>Heat a 10” crepe pan or flat bottomed non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, pour about 1/4 cup of batter and spread out in a circular shape to cover the entire pan. You want to create a very thin layer. Once the bottom begins to become toasted and golden, loosen the edges with a spatula and flip to toast the other side. Continue to flip another 2 times until the batter starts to crisp.</li>
        <li>Add desired filling - chocolate hazelnut spread and Edam cheese are traditional to the Yucatán Peninsula. Roll up into a big and wide roll. As soon as, you remove it from the heat it will begin to crisp up like a wafer cone. Enjoy!</li>
